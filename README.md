# First-AR-research-project
As a single woman in Los Angeles, personal safety is one of my highest priorities, but it can be difficult to determine the safety of any given neighborhood in spite of being a native Angeleno. My project aims to create an AR program utilizing rape and sexual assault crime statistics for any given neighborhood provided by the Los Angeles Police Department. I will also be considering bias in my project by attempting to eliminate bias by displaying crime statistics which allows the user to see objectively where sexual crimes take place rather than by reputation. Further, some neighborhoods have high crime statistics or are considered dangerous but are dangerous to specific people. For example, skid row in downtown Los Angeles is considered to be one of the most dangerous places in Los Angeles. However, the crimes committed there are mostly between the homeless people living in encampments, and not to the general public. Ultimately, I will explore to what extent open crime data can be used to inform women of their surrounding city environment, whilst eliminating bias.
